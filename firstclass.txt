Git Architecture: git architecture has 4 stages:

               1) Working Directory
               2) Staging Area
               3) Local Repo
               4) Remote Repo

Git Initialization for Tracking Files and Directories:


    1) First, we need to initialize a folder to monitor or let be known to git:
    
                git init 

    2) After initialization, you can check the git status. In this case, the files' color will be red because git will monitor the files but not track file changes. 
       git will monitor or known to be directory as git monitor: 
        ****This is the Working Area Stage of git Architecture******
                
                git status

    3) Now files are ready to be added to git tracking. For this, you need to add files or directories to track.
        ****This is the Staging Area Stage of git Architecture******

                git add files_name.extension

    4) Git commit -- means git will capture a snap and generate a hash.

                git commit -m "Message"             [m- means message] 

    git will return the messages: 100644

                10 -> Regular File
                0 -> Sticky bit / Special Permission
                6 -> Ownership Permission
                4-> Group Permission
                4-> Others Permission
